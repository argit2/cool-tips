Repository where I compile genuine tips I have to give

- 2021/02/17 vivaldi has very low ram consumption and is very performant. 10 youtube tabs use around 1.3gb of ram. it's also a very customizable browser with lots of features, such as tab stacks, and it supports chrome extensions.
- 2021/02/17 github files and gists can be modified right in the browser. very useful when your repository consists of only a readme (such as this one) or is a single script.
- 2021/02/17 adblockers such as ublock origin allow you to make your own rules to omit elements from a page. the syntax is a extended version of css selectors that allows you to filter elements based on the content (using text or regex), and to remove a specific parent element if the child matches.
  - syntax: `site1.com, site2.com #?# parent, child:-abp-contains(/keyword/)`
  - example: `youtube.com #?# ytd-rich-item-renderer, #video-title-link > .ytd-rich-grid-media.style-scope:-abp-contains(/hololive|reaction/)` will filter videos (ytd-rich-item-renderer) on youtube.com when their titles contains "hololive" or "reaction"
  - if you want to filter for multiple keywords, i recommend using regex `/keyword1|keyword2|keyword3/` instead of creating one filter per keyword, it's much more performant
- 2021/02/17 if you are already used to programming, cheatsheets for new languages and libraries and areas can be much more useful than courses and tutorials. for example, cheatsheets on python, pandas library, data science.

## chrome extensions
